# info: This variable defines the experiment in terms of a sequence of 'trials'. 'info' is a 1x54 struct array,
#       describing the 54 time intervals, or trials. Most of these time intervals correspond to trials during which the
#       subject views a single picture and a single sentence, and presses a button to indicate whether the sentence
#       correctly describes the picture. Other time intervals correspond to rest periods. The relevant fields of info
#       are illustrated in the following example:
#
# info(18) mint: 894 maxt: 948 cond: 2 firstStimulus: 'P' sentence: ''It is true that the star is below the plus.''
#       sentenceRel: 'below' sentenceSym1: 'star' sentenceSym2: 'plus' img: sap actionAnswer: 0 actionRT: 3613
#
# info.mint gives the time of the first image in the interval (the minimum time)
#
# info.maxt gives the time of the last image in the interval (the maximum time)
#
# info.cond has possible values 0,1,2,3. Cond=0 indicates the data in this segment should be ignored. Cond=1 indicates
#       the segment is a rest, or fixation interval. Cond=2 indicates the interval is a sentence/picture trial in which
#       the sentence is not negated. Cond=3 indicates the interval is a sentence/picture trial in which the sentence is
#       negated.
#
# info.firstStimulus: is either 'P' or 'S' indicating whether this trail was obtained during the session is which
#       Pictures were presented before sentences, or during the session in which Sentences were presented before
#       pictures. The first 27 trials have firstStimulus='P', the remained have firstStimulus='S'. Note this value is
#       present even for trials that are rest trials. You can pick out the trials for which sentences and pictures
#       were presented by selecting just the trials trials with info.cond=2 or info.cond=3.
#
# info.sentence gives the sentence presented during this trial. If none, the value is '' (the empty string).
#       The fields info.sentenceSym1, info.sentenceSym2, and info.sentenceRel describe the two symbols mentioned in the
#       sentence, and the relation between them.
#
# info.img describes the image presented during this trial. For example, 'sap' means the image contained a 'star above
#       plus'. Each image has two tokens, where one is above the other. The possible tokens are star (s), plus (p),
#       and dollar (d).
#
# info.actionAnswer: has values -1 or 0. A value of 0 indicates the subject is expected to press the answer button
#       during this trial (either the 'yes' or 'no' button to indicate whether the sentence correctly describes the
#       picture). A value of -1 indicates it is inappropriate for the subject to press the answer button during this
#       trial (i.e., it is a rest, or fixation trial).
#
# info.actionRT: gives the reaction time of the subject, measured as the time at which they pressed the answer button,
#       minus the time at which the second stimulus was presented. Time is in milliseconds. If the subject did not
#       press the button at all, the value is 0.

data = starplus['data']
# data: This variable contains the raw observed data. The fMRI data is a sequence of images collected over time, one
#       image each 500 msec. The data structure 'data' is a [54x1] cell array, with one cell per 'trial' in the
#       experiment. Each element in this cell array is an NxV array of observed fMRI activations. The element
#       data{x}(t,v) gives the fMRI observation at voxel v, at time t within trial x. Here t is the within-trial time,
#       ranging from 1 to info(x).len. The full image at time t within trial x is given by data{x}(t,:).
# Note the absolute time for the first image within trial x is given by info(x).mint.
